# Ferret Adoption

Ferret Adoption is a Ruby on Rails application that manages related data through complex forms and RESTful routes. The goal of the application is to build a Content Management System.

This project was inspired by a genuine need for regional ferret adoption groups to streamline their vetting and application procedures. This app provides a space where users can post information about the ferrets they own, and whether they are looking to adopt or rehome their animals.

To use this app, clone the repository, run bundle install for the necessary gems, rake db:migrate to create the database tables, and thin start --ssl to launch the web server. Navigate to https://localhost:3000
